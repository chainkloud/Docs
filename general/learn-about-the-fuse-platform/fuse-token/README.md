# Mix Token (MIX)

The MIX token is the native currency of the Mix blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## MIX utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Mix blockchain, MIX is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Mix to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100k. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.miexs.com/](https://status.miexs.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked MIX. Which means validators with higher amounts of Mix staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any MIX holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of MIX they wish. They receive a share of the Mix block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As MIX is the native currency on Mix, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, MIX transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of MIX tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Mix platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
