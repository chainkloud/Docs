# Network Overview and Key Metrics

Mix is the decentralized public blockchain that powers the Mix ecosystem. It is fully compatible with Ethereum meaning that any smart contract that can be deployed on the latter can also run on top of Mix.

The Mix blockchain uses a variant of delegated Proof of Stake \(dPoS\) for achieving consensus. The consensus is currently secured by 39 validators, only one of which is run by the Mix core team.

The blockchain is designed to ensure fast block confirmation times and a low cost of transactions. The average block interval on Mix is currently around 5 seconds, and it costs much less than $0.01 to get a transaction confirmed.

The following information will help you discover and connect to the Mix blockchain:
