# Mix: Ethereum â†” Mix

Mix native bridge between Ethereum and Mix is used to relay the Mix native token from Mix to Ethereum network

## Architecture Overview

The Mix bridged is based on POA's bridge implementation, it is used to transfer Mix tokens between the Mix chain and the Ethereum network.

Tokens sent to the respective bridge contract on one network \(whether it's Mix or Ethereum\) are "locked" in the bridge, "unlocked" on the other network bridge and transferred to the sender. The bridge contracts are deployed on both networks, and bridge oracle processes run on each validators machine as part of the validator deployment stack.

Besides the transfer of Mix tokens between the two networks, the bridge is also responsible for network core functionality events of relaying the block rewards to the Ethereum network:

**Mint block reward distributed on the Mix chain on Ethereum**

Each cycle the total block reward distributed on Mix chain is minted on Ethereum and locked on the bridge contract.

This works by listening to the \`RewardedOnCycle\` event emitted by the BlockReward contract on Mix chain, waiting for all bridge validators on Mix chain to sign it, and eventually sending a transaction to mint on Ethereum \(by the last signing validator\).

## Contracts

Home side of the bridge on the Mix network: [0xd617774b9708F79187Dc7F03D3Bdce0a623F6988](https://miexs.com/address/0xd617774b9708F79187Dc7F03D3Bdce0a623F6988/transactions)

Foreign side of the bridge on the Ethereum network: [0x1c7DFFd9313A0f3f20518E88735932D02bef4F28](https://miexs.com/address/0x1c7DFFd9313A0f3f20518E88735932D02bef4F28/transactions)

Mix token on the Ethereum network: [0x970B9bB2C0444F5E81e9d0eFb84C8ccdcdcAf84d](https://etherscan.io/token/0x970b9bb2c0444f5e81e9d0efb84c8ccdcdcaf84d)

## How to use

On Mix you send native Mix token to the home bridge contract. Then you receive an equal amount of the Mix token on the Ethereum network, sent from the foreign bridge contract

On Ethereum network you transfer the Mix token to the foreign bridge contract. After a couple of confirmations, you will receive equal amount of the Mix native token, sent from the home bridge contract.
